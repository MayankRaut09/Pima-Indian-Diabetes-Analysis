# Pima Indian Diabetes Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis project aimed at predicting the probability of diabetes in the Pima Indian population. The project includes a Jupyter Notebook with data modeling and analysis.

Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze medical data from the Pima Indian population and provide insights into diabetes risk using machine learning techniques. The project is primarily focused on the following components:

A Jupyter Notebook for data modeling and detailed analysis.
Files in the Repository
Pima_Indian_Diabetes_Analysis.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook includes the data processing, analysis, and modeling steps. It covers data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and the development of predictive models.
Jupyter Notebook Analysis
The Jupyter Notebook includes:

Data Loading and Cleaning: Importing the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset and performing necessary cleaning operations.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Detailed analysis of the data to uncover patterns and relationships.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features to improve the predictive models.
Model Development: Building and evaluating different machine learning models to predict diabetes risk.
How to Use
Jupyter Notebook:
Open the Pima_Indian_Diabetes_Analysis.ipynb file with Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and models.
Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed, such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, etc.
Requirements
Python and Jupyter Notebook: To run the Jupyter Notebook analysis.
